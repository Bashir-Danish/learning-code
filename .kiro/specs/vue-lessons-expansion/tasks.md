# Implementation Plan: Vue.js Lessons Comprehensive Expansion

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the expansion of all 27 Vue.js lessons into discrete, manageable tasks. The expansion will be executed in phases, starting with fundamentals, then intermediate, advanced, and expert levels. Each lesson will be expanded from 30-40 minutes of content to 90-120 minutes with 20+ code examples, real-world scenarios, best practices, and comprehensive explanations.

The implementation follows a consistent structure across all lessons to ensure coherence and ease of navigation for learners.
